              1. Resistance band pull-apart
             </h3>
            <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>A great exercise to kick off your back workout, the resistance band pull-apart is simple but effective. Choose a resistance band that allows you to complete 1–2 sets of 15–20 reps with good form.
</p>
            <p>
            <b>Muscles Worked: </b>The main movement of this exercise is scapular retraction, which means you’re pulling your shoulder blades together. This helps target upper back muscles such as the rhomboids, rear deltoids, and trapezius.
<br />Retraction exercises also help improve shoulder health by strengthening stabilizer muscles around your shoulders, such as those that make up your rotator cuff.

            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Directions:</b><br />
             <b>1. </b>
             Stand with arms extended. Hold a resistance band taut in front of you with both hands so the band is parallel to the floor.
             <br />
              <b>2. </b>
              Keeping arms straight, pull band to chest by moving your arms out to the sides. Initiate the
              <br />
              <b>3. </b>
              movement from your mid-back, squeeze your shoulder blades together, and keep your spine neutral. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.
              <br />
              <b>4. </b>
              Perform 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.
               <br />

            <h3> 2. Lat pulldown</h3>
            <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>The lat pulldown is a great staple exercise for building a strong back. You can complete a lat pulldown on a machine at the gym or with a resistance band.
</p>
            <p>
            <b>Muscles Worked: </b>As you can probably guess, lat pulldowns mainly target the latissimus dorsi, a large muscle located in the middle and lower back. This exercise also targets the trapezius, rotator cuff, posterior deltoids, rhomboids, biceps, and forearms.

            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Directions:</b><br />
             <b>1. </b>
             If you’re using a machine, position the pad so it’s touching your thighs. Stand up and grab the bar with hands wider than shoulder-width apart, then sit back down.
             <br />
              <b>2. </b>
              Begin to pull the bar down toward your chest, bending your elbows and pointing them toward the floor. Engage your upper back and mid-back throughout the move. Keep your torso straight, and don’t allow yourself to lean back.
               <br />
              <b>3. </b>
              Complete 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.

            <h3>3. Back extension</h3>
            <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>Back extensions target your whole posterior chain — in other words, the back side of your body. They’re a great beginner exercise.
</p>
            <p>
            <b>Muscles Worked: </b>Back extensions are great for targeting your back extensor muscles, known as the erector spinae muscles. They also target your hamstrings and glutes to some extent, depending on the variation you’re doing.

            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Directions:</b><br />
             <b>1. </b>
             Lie facedown on an exercise ball with your abdomen on the center of the ball. Press the balls of your feet into the floor behind you to stay balanced. You can position your feel against a wall for added support.
              <br />
              <b>2. </b>
              Extend your arms overhead, in line with your ears. Bend first at your waist, bringing your body down toward the floor. This is your starting position.
              <br />
              <b>3. </b>
              Slowly raise your upper body and arms toward the sky until your shoulders are above hip height. Engage your core and glutes and keep your feet on the floor.
               <br />
              <b>4. </b>
              Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower down.
               <br />
              <b>5. </b>
              Complete 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.

                <h3>    4. Suspended row </h3>
                <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>Using your body weight and requiring balance and stability, the suspended row is super-effective. The great thing about it is that it’s suitable for people of all ability levels. You’ll need a TRX trainer or another suspension trainer for this exercise.
</p>
                <p>
                <b>Muscles Worked: </b>Suspended rows target the three largest muscles of your back — the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and rhomboids. You’ll also strengthen your core, shoulders, and biceps with this move.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Directions:</b><br />
                 <b>1. </b>
                 Grab TRX handles and walk under them, forming a tabletop position with arms extended. The more parallel your back is to the floor, the harder this exercise will be. You can also do this move with straight legs, keeping your body in one straight line.
                  <br />
                  <b>2. </b>
                  Keeping your back straight and your elbows close to your sides, pull yourself up toward the ceiling.
                   <br />

                  <h3>     5. Wood chop</h3>
                  <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>A triple whammy for your core, arms, and back, the wood chop is a full-body movement. Use a dumbbell or medicine ball here — 10 pounds is a good place to start.
</p>
                  <p>
                  <b>Muscles Worked: </b>Wood chops are an excellent workout to strengthen your core muscles, such as your obliques and transversus abdominis. They also target your shoulders, upper back, and arms.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Directions:</b><br />
                   <b>1. </b>
                   Grab a dumbbell or medicine ball with both hands. Hold it overhead with arms straight.
                   <br />
                    <b>2. </b>
                    Rotate your hips to the left and bring the dumbbell or ball down to the outside of your left knee in a sweeping movement.
                    <br />
                    <b>3. </b>
                    On the ascent, twist your trunk back toward the right and, keeping your arms straight, bring the dumbbell or ball back up above the right side of your head in an explosive but controlled movement. This movement should mimic a chopping motion, hence the name.
                    <br />
                    <b>4. </b>

                  <h3>     6. Good morning</h3>
                  <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>Another exercise that targets your lower back, the good morning gets its name because the movement mirrors bowing as a way to say hello. This exercise is more advanced, so start without weight to ensure you have the right form before loading on a barbell.
</p>
                  <p>
                  <b>Muscles Worked: </b>Good mornings target many muscles along the back of your body, including your glutes, hamstrings, erector spinae, and upper back muscles.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Directions:</b><br />
                   <b>1. </b>
                   If using weight, safely mount a barbell on your shoulders behind your head. Position your feet shoulder-width apart.
                   <br />
                    <b>2. </b>
                    Hinging at your hips, soften your knees and lower your torso toward the floor, stopping when it’s parallel to the floor. Your back should remain straight throughout this movement.
                    <br />
                    <b>3. </b>
                    Once you reach parallel, push through your feet and return to the starting position. Complete 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.

                  <h3>     7. Quadruped single-arm dumbbell row</h3>
                  <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>This exercise takes you back to the basics of the row, fixing many form issues such as over-rowing at the top of the movement, overstretching your arm at the bottom of the movement, and compensating with your lower back. Do this exercise before completing any other rowing movements.
</p>
                  <p>
                  <b>Muscles Worked: </b> This move emphasizes your upper back muscles, including your latissimus dorsi, teres minor, teres major, posterior deltoids, rhomboids, and trapezius. It’ll also help build strength in your arms. What’s more, it can help you fix muscular imbalances by targeting each side individually.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Directions:</b><br />
                   <b>1. </b>
                   Start on hands and knees with a dumbbell positioned in each hand. Ensure your back is straight, your hands are directly below your shoulders, and your knees are directly below your hips.
                    <br />
                    <b>2. </b>
                    Row up and back with your right arm, bending your elbow and bringing the dumbbell to your armpit. Keep your elbow tucked at your side throughout the movement. You’ll notice that if you row too far, you’ll lose your balance.
                     <br />
                    <b>3. </b>
                    Slowly return the dumbbell to the starting position and repeat on the left side.

                  <h3>    8. Wide dumbbell bent-over row </h3>
                  <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>Mimicking a barbell row, a wide dumbbell row allows you an increased range of motion and can help you address muscular imbalances between sides. Choose light- to moderate-weight dumbbells to start — 10 pounds should work — and work your way up from there. If you have lower back issues, use caution with this exercise.
</p>
                  <p>
                  <b>Muscles Worked: </b>This move targets most of the muscles in your back, such as your latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, trapezius, and erector spinae.

                   Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your thighs, and stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees slightly, keeping core engaged and neck neutral, and hinge at the hips until your torso forms a 45-degree angle with the floor. Allow the dumbbells to hang down in front of you.
                   <br />
                    <b>2. </b>
                    Begin to row with your elbows at a 90-degree angle, pulling them up toward the ceiling. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top.

                  <p><b>Why it's on the list :</b>The barbell deadlift is an excellent compound movement, meaning it targets many muscle groups at the same time. It hits the entire posterior chain — from your upper back all the way down to your calves — making it a great full-body move.
</p>
                  <p>
                  <b>Muscles Worked: </b>Working the erector spinae muscles, hamstrings, glutes, and shoulder stabilizers, a barbell deadlift requires back strength to effectively complete.

                  </p>

                    <b>3. </b>
                    Keeping feet flat on the floor, push back up to a standing position. Your back should remain straight throughout the movement, and your shoulders should be down and back.
