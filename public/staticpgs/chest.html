            <h3>1. Incline push up </h3>
            <p><b>Equipment required:</b> none</p>
            <p>This is a good warmup to prepare the chest for work. Research has shown that a dynamic warmup is helpful in preventing injury prior to training. Lower resistance movements related to those you are about to perform prepares the muscles for work (6Trusted Source).</p>
            <p>
             <b>1. </b> Start with your hands on the wall or a countertop height surface. Walk your feet back so that your body makes roughly a 45 degree angle with the floor.<br />
              <b>2. </b> Keep your body straight and your spine neutral, and lower your chest to the surface you’re leaning against.<br />
              <b>3. </b> Pause for a moment, then return to the start position.<br />
              <b>4. </b> Make sure the resistance feels light enough to complete up to 20 repetitions. If you need to make it easier, step closer to your hands; to make it harder, step farther away.<br />
            </p>

            <h3>2. Flat bench press </h3>
            <p><b>Equipment required:</b> barbell or dumbbells, flat bench</p>
             <p>
              <b>1. </b> Lie on your back on the bench with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Grasp the barbell, with your thumb wrapped around the barbell and palms facing toward your feet. Press your arms straight toward the ceiling to lift the weight off the rack.<br />
              <b>2. </b> Move the weight over chest level.<br />
              <b>3. </b> Bending your elbows down at a 45-degree angle, slowly lower the weight to your chest. Keep the bar approximately in line with your nipples.<br />
              <b>4. </b> Pause for a moment, then press the weight back to the start position.<br />
              <b>5. </b>Complete 3 sets of 8–12 repetitions.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
            Remember to keep your back flat and maintain good control of the weight. Also keep your neck neutral to avoid excessive strain. <br />It’s recommended to enlist the help of a spotter to ensure safety in this exercise.

              <p><b>Equipment required:</b> barbell or dumbbells, incline bench</p>
               <p>
                <b>1. </b> Lie on your back on the incline bench with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Grasp the barbell, with your thumb wrapped around the barbell and palms facing toward your feet. Press your arms straight toward the ceiling to lift the weight off the rack.
        <br />
                <b>2. </b>Position the weight above your collarbone.<br />
                <b>3. </b>
                Slowly lower the weight down to your chest, approximately in line with your mid-chest to just above your nipples.

                <b>4. </b>
                Pause, then press the weight back to the start position.

              <p>
                As with the flat bench, remember to keep your back flat and your feet flat throughout the movement. And, again, it’s highly recommended that you do this exercise with someone spotting you.
